#Overview of Project:#
##A code was written to quickly pull stock data from 2018 and 2017 and analyze their losses or gain through the time period in a matter of seconds. ##
#Results:#
##With the exception of RUN and ENPH all stocks did worse in 2018. 2018 took a few miliseconds longer to analyze by code.    startTime = Timer
    
    'Format the output sheet on All Stocks Analysis worksheet
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    
    Range("A1").Value = "All Stocks (" + yearValue + ")"
    
    'Create a header row
    Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"
    Cells(3, 2).Value = "Total Daily Volume"
    Cells(3, 3).Value = "Return"##
#Summary:#

##The advantages of the refactoring code are the speed increases. However, the disadvantage is is that is that is the speed is insignificant. Miliseconds are too fast to make a difference to the human mind. It would be easier to stick to the original format for the few miliseconds saved.##
